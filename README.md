These early examples show how to use terraform to extract data from the bridgecrew platform, and how to create policies in code.

## example_provider/

How to set-up the provider and authentication.

Add your bridgecrew API key as an Environmental variable:

```bash
export BRIDGECREW_API="xxxx"
```

## example_data/

Demonstrates the 6 of the current data sources for repositories, policies, suppressions and the newer authors,incidents and justifications.

## example_simple_policy/

Demonstrates how to create a basic policy in Terraform.

## example_yaml_policy/

Demonstrates how to create a yaml policy in Terraform.

Each Folder has a video walk-through.

## example_connected/

This examples shows you how to create a policy and then using it against some IaC.
Check a Terraform template against your current policy set, buy running the Make target fail:

```bash
make fail
```

This template would provision an aws_instance of the instance_type *t3.medium*.

Then we add a new policy that checks that the instance size of the aws_instance resource is "t3.micro", run the Make Target policy:

```bash
make policy
```

Once the policy is deployed you can test it again with previous Make fail target:

```bash
make fail 
```

And you should see (In your Checkov output):

```bash
Check: james_aws_1636551748078: "Ensure Developers use the AWS free tier"
        FAILED for resource: aws_instance.non_compliant
        File: /aws_instance.non_compliant.tf:18-27

                18 | resource "aws_instance" "non_compliant" {
                19 |    # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_79: ADD REASON
                20 |   ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
                21 |   instance_type = "t3.medium"
                22 |     root_block_device {
                23 |     encrypted = true
                24 |   }
                25 |   monitoring = true
                26 |   ebs_optimized = true
                27 | }
```

Finally remove the added check with target destroy:

```bash
make destroy
```

## example tag

This example shows how to define a tag rule for the platform.
